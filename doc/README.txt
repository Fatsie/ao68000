The ao68000 core documentation is generated by the Doxygen tool
(www.doxygen.org) with the doxverilog patch
(http://developer.berlios.de/projects/doxverilog/).

A generated copy of the documentation is included. Because of its size, it is
stored in an compressed archive: doxygen_generated.tar.gz.

To decompress it type:
make unpack

To open the documentation, open the file:
./doxygen/html/index.html
in a browser.
